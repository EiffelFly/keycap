# keycap
Keycap is a component library for you to handle keyboard event, more specificaly, Keybinds.

## Problem 1 - Lack of centralize keybinds rule
There are lots of keybinds in current web browser, some of them can be overwrite(preventDefault), some can't. This make maintain or develop app harder. We provide single interface that have access to all major browsers' default keybinds across major operation system.

## Problem 2 - Lack of simple UI for user to easily manipulate keybinds.
Usually developer displaying keybind as a list, but as human we are hard to remember things that don't have hint, list is one of them, this make managing keybinds hard and trouble prone. Keycap provide a new UI interface for user to interact with their keybinds in a much easier manner.
